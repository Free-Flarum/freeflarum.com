We have handed them our most precious asset: our attention and trust. In recent years the dangers have shown. Proliferation of fake news, undemocratic actors gaining influence over elections, mass manipulation for commercial interest. Google and Facebook make an effort to (publicly) fight this, but their hands are tied by their shareholder masters -- who demand profits. It is time that society regains that power. And we should start with communication. There is no reason why the exchange of ideas should be subjected to profits or political stakes. The FreeFlarum vision is simple: people will get increasingly sick of multinationals monetizing their lives. And an open platform such as Flarum is a fantastic means to take some power back in our own hands. Mission & values \u2693\ufe0e FreeFlarum works to make online communities simple and available to anyone. It complements the awesome, open source Flarum software with a click-and-go service, that provides free, instant and maintenance free forums that can be used by anyone. Mission: people will be the owner of their online communities once again When you cancel a service, you can tell if a company is a \u201cKeep Customers\u201d company (hostile, tricky policies, retention mazes, etc) or a \u201cKeep Customers Happy\u201d company (easy to cancel, well wishes, fair policies, etc). \u2014 Jason Fried (@jasonfried) July 16, 2018 We are a \"keep customers happy\" company. You are the owner of your forum/data. We will not lock you in, in any way. If you want to move your forum elsewhere, we will totally facilitate that. We will not use dark marketing patterns. Strategy \u2693\ufe0e Feature requests are weighed using the FreeFlarum priorities: Does it make starting and managing communities easier? Lowers entry barrier to use? Makes managing a community more fun? Helps improve forum engagement? Does it contribute to keep FreeFlarum a sustainable project? Does it contribute to Flarum itself? Attracts more forums? Attracts larger forums?","title":"About FreeFlarum"},{"location":"about/#about-freeflarum","text":"","title":"About FreeFlarum"},{"location":"about/#vision","text":"The tech giants AmaFaceGooAppTwit have won enormous power over our society.

However, some extensions are incompatible with the FreeFlarum platform. For example, we can not install anything that runs custom PHP code (for security). You can see all pending requests here or add your own: Github . Extensions with more upvotes will be prioritized. How many users does FreeFlarum support? \u2693\ufe0e FreeFlarum is meant for smaller forums that would like to start a community and supports up to 250 users. When you have more users or your forum negatively affects the performance of other forums, we may ask you to move your forum elsewhere, and we also reserve the right to cancel your forum, if necessary. Read our Terms & Conditions , article 3. for more information How do I delete my forum? \u2693\ufe0e To take your forum down, go to your FreeFlarum settings and click on the red \"DESTROY\" button at the bottom of the page. All archived forums will be kept for 6 months, then they're deleted forever. If you'd like to destroy your forum permanently sooner, please E-mail us . Can I pay to remove the \"Powered by FreeFlarum\" footer for my or other forum? \u2693\ufe0e FreeFlarum doesn't have paid accounts and runs entirely on donations. Those are very much welcome, because running this service takes many hours of our unpaid time. And servers aren't free to rent either ;) Should you make a voluntary donation, we say \"thank you!\", will name our first born after you and will remove the FreeFlarum footer link on your forum. The amount of the donation is entirely up to you: how much is FreeFlarum worth to you? You can learn more at the Donation page . Note If you want to donate more, just donate a custom amount to the following PayPal E-Mail: info@freeflarum.com. Warning Don't forget to add your forum name (part before .flarum.cloud or .freeflarum.com ) in the donation message, or else we won't know which footer to remove. Note If you donate less than $5, Paypal will take nearly all of it as \"transaction fees\". You may also remove footers on the behalf of other forums. All donations are processed manually - usually within 24 hours from the time the invoice E-Mail has arrived to our mailbox. If your footer is not removed within a day, it means that the receipt didn't arrive or we overlooked it. If that's the case, please E-mail us the PayPal receipt and we will sort it out. For a FAQ, please read the Donation FAQ below. Donation FAQ \u2693\ufe0e Why are you providing \"perks\" based on the amount donated. Why not make a paid plans instead? \u2693\ufe0e FreeFlarum's goal is to be a free service that allows users across the planet to create their own online community, without any fees or hidden payments, privacy or data locking, etc. A paid plans system is not what we are looking for in order to keep FreeFlarum up and running. It would make people think that we are a commercial service, which we aren't. Soon, they might start to have higher expectations on us, in terms of support speed and forum speed. We can't guarantee you that. FreeFlarum is run by a small team of voluentary people that operate it in their free time. We can't offer people what we can't. Since we aren't being paid for what we do, a donation is always welcome. We need money in order to keep FreeFlarum up and running. But for that, we need some income. So we've decided to create a donation tier system. Donating is optional and will provide the forum some perks in return (so that people are actually willing to donate). These perks should not significantly make a difference between other forums (in terms of support or forum speed, for example). They are merely a token of gratitude, and for people that want a bit more features. They won't give you any sort of forum performance boost, or separate server. They will give you just exactly what's listed at the Donation page . I have donated. Will I get faster response times from support (or any other benefits not listed at the donation page)? \u2693\ufe0e No, you get what you have donated for only. Can I donate more? \u2693\ufe0e Yes, it will be added to the amount that you've previously donated, and you will advance to the tier that corresponds to the new donation amount. I am able to upload files locally. What if the uploaded files take too much disk space of yours? \u2693\ufe0e We will ask you to limit file uploads. At critical values (point when the disk is too full and disallows FreeFlarum to operate properly), we will purge the uploaded files and ask you to self host your forum instead. I hope that you understand that FreeFlarum is still a free service and we are not a commercial entity - therefore, we can't guarantee you a limitless hosting solution for Flarum. Mail issues \u2693\ufe0e How can I send all users an E-mail? \u2693\ufe0e Sending mass-mails is currently not supported due to the risk of a spam attack, which would quickly mark our mail server as \"spam\" and would cost us a bad domain reputation. My E-mails won't send. Why? \u2693\ufe0e This is often caused by wrong mail settings. Please, review this guide if you need help setting up mails. Additionally, you can contact still contact us . Software updates \u2693\ufe0e What happens when Flarum has a new release? \u2693\ufe0e Small (security) releases will be applied right away. You shouldn't have to worry about that! You won't have to worry about bigger releases either, as FreeFlarum takes care of all data migration. There is one caveat though: after a release has been published by Flarum, FreeFlarum waits until the most popular extensions have been updated to work with the new release. If extensions haven't been updated after 3 weeks of a new release, the extension will be deprecated and removed from FreeFlarum. If a compatible version is released, you can request the extension to be re-added . Other questions \u2693\ufe0e Can you hire me to work for FreeFlarum? \u2693\ufe0e FreeFlarum does not do consultancy, as it distracts from our objective to build the best platform. But there are several highly skilled Flarum developers available on the Flarum forum that you could contact. Will you help us if we outgrow your platform? \u2693\ufe0e If you need custom modifications and/or want to move away for any other reason, FreeFlarum happily shares the stack and configuration settings with your engineers for a smooth transition. Our objective is happy Flarum users, either on our platform or elsewhere. Where are your servers located? \u2693\ufe0e Currently we use Cloudflare behind the main website and Hetzner. If growth continues, we plan to expand to Asia and the US to improve loading times across the globe.","title":"FaQ"},{"location":"faq/#faq","text":"","title":"FaQ"},{"location":"faq/#general-issues","text":"","title":"General Issues"},{"location":"faq/#can-you-add-extension-x","text":"We will add most extensions based on requests .

Forums that violate these regulations will be suspended without prior notice. 1. Your forum mustn't contain: spam, pornography, or other illegal activities per your valid state regulations and laws, such as, but not limited to: multi-level marketing schemes, warez/pirated/cracked content sharing (eg.: content that is normally paid for but shared for free), sharing personal details of other people without their consent, abusive and/or hate speech, homophobia, racism, etc. FreeFlarum forums are also forbidden to link to external third-party websites & services containing previously mentioned forbidden content. 2. FreeFlarum is directed to people who are at least 13 years old. If you are under the age of 13 without having your parent's/legal guardian's consent, per the requirements of COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), you can't use the FreeFlarum service. 3. The service applies a fair use policy towards resources (storage, server capacity and traffic) of free accounts. The limits are five times the average of all users of the service. Specifically, this means that no more than 250 users per forum are supported. This limit may be surpassed and your forum can function properly, however we do not provide support for forums above the limit because we don't officially support them - if you want to run a busy forum, your best option might be to self-host it instead. 4. You are allowed to modify the full appearance of your forum (through the \"Administration\" panel at your Flarum instance), but it is not allowed to change the appearance as in to hide or otherwise hinder the displayed advertisements of FreeFlarum, such as the FreeFlarum footer. If you would like to remove that footer, please see this page . 5. FreeFlarum reserves the right to cancel forums that are detrimental to its quality of service or reputation, at its sole discretion. 6. Forums that are not used for more than 3 months (no logins/posts/visitors) may be removed without prior notice. These forums may be reactivated upon a request from the forum's owner.

But it is easy (and free) to use your own domain name. It looks more professional and also ensures your independence of FreeFlarum. If you ever want to migrate your forum elsewhere, you can keep the same name (and data). To start using your own domain name, follow these steps: Get a domain name, with a registrar such as namecheap.com or gandi.net. Add a CNAME DNS record at the registrar's control panel ( What is DNS? ) Enter your custom domain on the FreeFlarum Settings page Configuring the DNS can be tricky, because every registrar has a different method and rules to do so. We will try to tell you some basics. General DNS instructions You should create a CNAME record from your own domain name to FreeFlarum, which looks something like this: subdomain.yourdomain.tld. 300 IN CNAME yourforumname.freeflarum.com (note that DNS record usually ends with a dot - . ) TTL Your provider might ask for a TTL, you should set this as low as possible, eg. 2 minutes. This allows you to change servers quickly, if necessary. Using a root/naked domain A domain without a subdomain (eg \"your.com\" instead of \"www.your.com\") is called a \"root\" domain. It is currently incompatible with FreeFlarum and can't be used. There's one trick to \"fake\" the root functionality of your domain by simply using a \"www\" subdomain. Or, you can make a redirect from your root domain to your subdomain linked to FreeFlarum. Example: \u2022 You Note If you keep getting an error from FreeFlarum saying that a CNAME cannot be found, first double check whether a CNAME can be found using a third party tool .
