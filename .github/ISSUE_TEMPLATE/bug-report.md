READ ME:

Please, report FreeFlarum related bugs only (eg. error when creating/deleting forum, can't access my site, my forum is down...)

Usually, bugs come from the installed extensions. Please, check what extension you've enabled when your forum stopped working and then disable
that extension (if you are able to access your admin panel). If you can't access your admin panel, please follow this issue template.

[How can I check whether it is an extension or FreeFlarum error?]
Answer the following questions for yourself:
1. Did my forum stop behaving correctly since I have enabled an extension?
2. Did I clear my forum cache?
3. Did I contact the extension author?

Sometimes, clearing your forum cache helps (Administration > Dashboard > Tools > Clear Cache).

If not, in 90% cases, the bug comes from an extension. If you're an advanced user, you can open your JavaScript console for possible errors. If you don't see any, please
follow this template. If you do, try to deduct from what extension does the error come and report it to extension authors.

You can view available extensions and their Packagist URLs (with contact information for developers) at https://freeflarum.com/extensions.

If the developer provided a fix, please open a new extension (update) request or contact us at Discuss: https://discuss.flarum.org/d/7585
