__Why we should install this extension?__

__Proof that extension works on the latest Flarum version (eg.: statement by author, image, URL link to the statement, forum that has the extension...):__

<!-- 
Most extensions have their official discussion at https://discuss.flarum.org. 
If they are labeled as "incompatible" there, it means that they are incompatible
with Flarum, and therefore they will not work at FreeFlarum either. Sorry.
