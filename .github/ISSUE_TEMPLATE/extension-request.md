<!-- 
Most extensions have their official discussion at https://discuss.flarum.org. 
If they are labeled as "incompatible" there, it means that they are incompatible
with Flarum, and therefore they will not work at FreeFlarum either. Sorry.

You can also check for version requirements at the extension's Packagist page.

You can quickly navigate to the discussion page by doing a quick search with keywords 
such as "<extension name> Flarum" and you should get link to the Discuss. 
Most extension authors also leave a link to the discussion at Discuss in the README.md 
file in their GitHub repository.

If you cannot find any discussion related to the extension at Discuss, there is also a
possibility that it simply doesn't exist (yes, that is possible too).

Also please note that extensions that are not labeled as incompatible at Discuss could
still not be compatible with Flarum (Bazaar for example, see the top note, pinned issues or simply #18)
