<!-- NOTE ->
As a response to FreeFlarum crashes from 15th to 20th July 2022 (https://discuss.flarum.org/d/7585/3828),
all extension requests MUST follow the template and MUST have at least 5 upvotes in order for them to be considered, and later added to FreeFlarum.
This is to make sure that users actually want the extension to be added.

Users that do not follow the template will be asked to provide a valid reason why should this extension be installed. Failing/not providing that will result in your request having lower priority, and the extension will have a less chance of being actually added to FreeFlarum.
