!!! quote "About"
    This extension adds a Night Mode ðŸŒ™ for your users to use on your Flarum forum. They can toggle it by clicking on a button in the navigation bar dropdown menu.

!!! info "Usage"
    Currently, this extension works better if your forum isn't in Night Mode by default (option in the "Appearance" settings). In the case you have Night Mode on your forum, it will only darken the top navigation bar.

    If you want your users to be able to toggle between night and day mode, you should keep "Night Mode" in "Appearance" off.
    
    Use the "Night Mode" button in top navigation bar dropdown to toggle between night & day mode.
