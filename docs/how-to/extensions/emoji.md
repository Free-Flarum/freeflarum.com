!!! quote "About"
    This extension converts text and unicode emoji into [Twitter's Twemoji](https://twemoji.twitter.com/) in posts & discussions at your Flarum forum.
    
!!! question "Where can I see list of available emoticons?"
    With over +2,000 emojis currently available in Twemoji, it is hard to remember all of them. [Here](https://emojipedia.org/twitter/) you can take a look at all of them
    (please note that the page might take a while to load, and may slow down your computer too due to a lot of emojis listed).
    
!!! question "How can I insert an emoji into a post?"
    Just start to type `:` (colon) and a few of them available to choose will pop up:
    
    ![The emoji picker](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/585143304467906581/710398796676464722/unknown.png)
    
    You can then search for emojis there too! Or you can just directly paste an Unicode emoji - it will be converted into Twemoji automatically.
    
!!! question "Can I add my own emojis?"
    Unfortunately, that is currently not possible ._.
