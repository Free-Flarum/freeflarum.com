!!! question "Usage"
    - **Author edit:**
    - - Users with "Update author" permission must also have the "View user list" permission to be able to search for users.

    **Date edit:**
    - - The field uses the native datetime-local picker in browsers that support it (at the time of writing, Chrome/Edge/Opera).
    - - The field format in supported browser will match your browser/operating system language and country setting.
    - - The time in the modal is UTC.

    **Other:**
    - - The first post of a discussion and the discussion itself are not automatically synced.
    - - You will probably want to edit the data in both places.
    
    Options to edit the posts & discussions are available when clicking on the post & discussion settings
