!!! question "Usage"
    First, enable the extension. It has no settings in the Administration panel, so you are good to go and no additional setup is required.

    A new "Add poll" button has been added to the post composer.
    Clicking on it will open the following dialog:

    Here, we see a few settings:

    - **Question** - The question to ask your users. Example: "Do you like red or green apples?".

    - **Answers** - There can be more of them. They're basically options your users can choose from. Example (could be used along with the first question): Answer #1: "Red"; Answer #2: "Green".

    - **Poll end date** - This setting is optional. It allows you to choose the end date of the poll - after that time, no more votes can be cast. The UI is fancy and easy to choose:

    - **Allow people to see who voted** - Defaults to false/off. If this is on, it allows users to see who voted on a poll.

    This extension also adds a few permissions to the "Permissions" tab in your Administration panel:

    - **Start a poll** - Allows the user to create a poll.

    - **Vote on polls** - Allows the user to vote on a poll.

    - **Allow users to edit their own polls** - "Allow users to edit their own polls". Quite obvious `¯\\_(ツ)_/¯`

    - **Edit & remove polls** - Allows the user to edit other polls and to delete them.
