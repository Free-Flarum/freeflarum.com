!!! quote "About"
    This extension generates a sitemap for Flarum.
    
!!! question "What is a sitemap?"
    In short, a sitemap is a list of pages of a website. You can learn more [here](https://www.ccmarketingonline.com/what-is-a-sitemap/). This extension generates a XML Sitemap.
    XML sitemap is mainly used for search engines such as Google to recognize links and pages around your forum that are not accessible from elsewhere. This will improve your page rank and search engine visibility.
    
!!! question "Where is my sitemap located?"
    After you have enabled the extension from your Administrator panel, the sitemap should be generated at 
    
    `your-forum-name.flarum.cloud`**/sitemap.xml**
    
    If you don't see it, or a bug occured, please [report it here](https://github.com/gwillem/freeflarum.com/issues/new/choose).
    
!!! question "What do I do with a sitemap?"
    You can submit it to Google, so Googlebot can fetch data from your site better and more efficiently. You can [learn more here](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/183668).
