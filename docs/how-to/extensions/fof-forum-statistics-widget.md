!!! quote "About"
    This extension adds a forum statistics widget to the sidebar of your forum. It contains basic information, such as number of discussions & posts, member count and the most recent member.
    
!!! tip "Settings"
    This extension comes with a few settings:
    
    - **Ignore Private Discussions:** If you have enabled the By≈çbu extension, this setting won't add private discussion & posts to the total discussion & post count (defaults to true).
    - **Widget Order:** Edit this setting to adjust this widget's position on the sidenav section of your Flarum forum. The higher the number, the higher this widget will be on the sidenav items list (this value can be either positive or negative). For example, positive number will place widget on the top of navbar items. Negative number will place it to the bottom instead (default value is 0).
