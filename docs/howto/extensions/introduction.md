# Introduction to extensions

### What are extensions?
Extensions (or sometimes also "addons") are pieces of scripts that can extend your Flarum forum.
They can add many useful things to your forum that aren't avaliabe in the default Flarum.

Here at FreeFlarum, extensions are treated a little different. For example, if you want your extension
to be added, you have to request it [here](https://www.github.com/gwillem/freeflarum.com/issues). 

### The extension I am looking for is not on the list. How do I add an extension? 
If you want your extension to be added, you need to [request an extension](https://github.com/gwillem/freeflarum.com/issues/new/choose).

### Can extensions break my forum?
Yes, some extensions aren't compatible with Flarum or they are outdated. Please note that we do not check extensions every day if they are compatible or not.
If you see any error, you should [report it](https://www.github.com/gwillem/freeflarum.com/issues).

Keep in mind that we do not develop extensions. Extensions are brought to you by the Flarum community.
If there is a bug in extension itself, you will most likely need to contact the extension author for a fix.
If he abandoned the extension for some reason we're just sorry but we can't really help you with that.

### When will the X extension update?
We work hard to keep all of your forums as up to date as possible. But you can always request to update a specific extension [here](https://www.github.com/gwillem/freeflarum.com/issues).

## I need more help...
Don't hesitate to [open up an issue](https://www.github.com/gwillem/freeflarum.com/issues/new) then. We will be happy to respond to you as fast as possible.
