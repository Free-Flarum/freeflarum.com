# Authentication

## Forgot password?

FreeFlarum's login form expects the same password hash as is your forum admin account's password.
This means that if you forgot your password, you may reset it at your forum:

1. Ensure that you are logged out (you can use incognito/private browsing);
2. Click on the "Log In" button at your Flarum forum;
3. Click on the "Forgot password?" link in the bottom of the modal;
4. Input your admin's E-mail address;
5. Follow the instructions that were sent to that E-mail address and reset your password;
6. You may now use this new password to log in to FreeFlarum.
