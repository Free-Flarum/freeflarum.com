!!! quote "About"
    This extension is the default language for Flarum, and is always enabled by default. It should also be kept enabled, as if you disable it, nothing will be translated, resulting in a mess.
    If you have any other language pack, leave the English one enabled, as missing translations from that pack should fallback to the default English one.
    
!!! tip
    You can have multiple language packs enabled, allowing you to choose between languages from the language selector.
