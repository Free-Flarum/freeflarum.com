# Login with Github

In order to setup GitHub login, you firstly need to create a [GitHub App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/creating-a-github-app/)

To create a GitHub App, navigate to your __User Settings__:
![OwO, first we need to navigate to user settings!](https://snag.gy/u6xanc.jpg)

Navigate to __Developer Settings:__
![ÓwÓ, now this is something devilish!](https://snag.gy/zbsdRL.jpg)

Click on __OAuth Apps__, then on __New OAuth App__ button:
![ôwô, much wows!](https://snag.gy/szy9Vd.jpg)

Now, fill in some basic and required settings:
![finally we made it!](https://snag.gy/xP05qT.jpg)

The __Authorization callback URL__ is the most important part. It has to be set to `yourforum.freeflarum.com/auth/github`.
If you are using a [Custom Domain](/docs/How-to/Custom-Domain/), just add the `/auth/github` to the end of your domain.

Once you have successfuly created your __OAuth App__, you should be redirected to a page similar to this:

![oh no, even more steps!!? c'mon!](https://snag.gy/eE7jSt.jpg)

The __Client ID__ and __Client Secret__ area is important. You will input those credentials to your GitHub Login extension at your admin dashboard.
If you haven't enabled the extension already, go to https://yourforumname.freeflarum.com/admin#/extensions. 
Find the __GitHub Login__ extension and enable it by clicking on it.
![yey! GitHub Login located!](https://snag.gy/eOEtAa.jpg)

Another modal should popup, with __Client ID__ and __Client Secret__ fields. You probably know what to do now - copy your __Client Credentials__ from your __App__ page and paste it into this modal.
Hit save.

![oh, where are you sneaky modal? OH, THERE YOU ARE!!!](https://snag.gy/VZIxkf.jpg)

If you have enabled GitHub Login already, you can click on the dotted navigation menu popup to revive the sneaky modal we mentioned above.

![we DID IT!!!](https://snag.gy/YXJNoO.jpg)

If you did all the steps above correctly, congratulations! Your users should be able to login with GitHub now! You can test it in __Incognito Mode__, if supported.

If an error appeared after logining in using GitHub, please [open up a new issue](https://github.com/gwillem/freeflarum.com/issues/new), so we can look into it!
